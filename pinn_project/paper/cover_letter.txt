Dear Editor,

We submit for consideration our manuscript titled "Multi-Method Validation Framework for Teaching Radiation Transport: Comparing Monte Carlo, Analytical, and Physics-Informed Machine Learning Approaches" for publication in the European Journal of Physics.

This work addresses a critical gap in computational physics education: the validation of AI-driven models against established physics. Our educational framework demonstrates how Monte Carlo simulation, analytical theory, and physics-informed neural networks complement each other, with quantifiable improvements (52.5%) from physics constraints.

Key contributions include:
1. First application of PINNs to radiation transport education
2. Complete open-source framework with pre-trained models
3. Systematic ablation study revealing when physics constraints help/hurt
4. Cross-material validation demonstrating framework generalizability

The manuscript is appropriate for EJP's focus on physics education and includes classroom-ready materials. All authors have approved this submission. The work has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal.

We suggest the following potential reviewers:
- Prof. [Expert in PINNs]
- Prof. [Expert in physics education]  
- Prof. [Expert in medical physics education]

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Yash Varshney
On behalf of all authors
